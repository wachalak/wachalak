## Projects

Here is my thesis & research internship project:

[Joint fused ridge-regularized methylation networks modelling pig foetal development](https://github.com/wachalak/Methylation_networks) 🐖
   
   - We implemented joint fused ridge regularized network extraction to visualize the dynamics of methylation patterns spanning seven swine tissues
at three developmental stages. We informed the penalty matrices guiding regularization with results from hierarchical clustering of RNA-Seq data.
   - We used the rags2risges R package for network extraction, visualization and analysis.
