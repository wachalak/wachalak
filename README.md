# Hi c:

I'm Karolina, a MSc student in Bioinformatics at Wageningen University & Research, with a focus on genomics and statistical machine learning. 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## Research interests

   🧬 Genomics
   🧬 Machine Learning & Statistics
   🧬 Bioinformatics
   🧬 Developmental Biology
   🧬 Evolutionary Biology

I am a team player, a critical thinker, and a lifelong learner, driven by the quest to unravel the mysteries encoded within genomic data using novel computational approaches. 
I want to pursue a PhD in computational biology, focusing on genomic research.

## Skills & Expertise

- **Genomics** & **Epigenomics**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Statistics**
- **Bioinformatics Tools**
- **Collaboration**

## Projects

Here is my thesis & research internship project:

1. [Joint fused ridge-regularized methylation networks modelling pig foetal development](https://github.com/wachalak/Methylation_networks) 🐖
   
   - We implemented joint fused ridge regularized network extraction to visualize the dynamics of methylation patterns spanning seven swine tissues
at three developmental stages. We informed the penalty matrices guiding regularization with results from hierarchical clustering of RNA-Seq data.
   - We used the rags2risges R package for network extraction, visualization and analysis.
