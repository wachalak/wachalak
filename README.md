# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Karolina, MSc student in Bioinformatics at Wageningen University & Research, with a focus on genomics and statistical machine learning. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## About Me

During my masterâ€™s education, I've delved deep into the complexities of biological datasets, particularly in the wake of the omics revolution. These experiences made me realize:

- ðŸ§¬ The importance of a multidisciplinary outlook on complex biological datasets through collaboration with researchers from various backgrounds.
- ðŸ§¬ The need to bridge the qualitative-quantitative divide, especially in today's era where data collection has become cheap while inference remains expensive.

I am a team player, a critical thinker, and a lifelong learner, driven by the quest to unravel the mysteries encoded within genomic data. My ultimate goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in computational biology, with a focus on advancing genomic research.

## Skills & Expertise

- **Genomics**: Proficient in analyzing genomic data, identifying patterns, and extracting meaningful insights.
- **Statistical Machine Learning**: Skilled in applying machine learning techniques to analyze biological datasets and make predictions.
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Experienced in using bioinformatics tools and software for data analysis and visualization.
- **Collaboration**: Strong ability to collaborate with researchers from diverse backgrounds to tackle complex biological problems.

## Projects

Here is my thesis & research internship project:

1. [Fused ridge-regularized methylation networks during pig development](Link to project repository or website)
   - We implemented joint fused ridge regularized network extraction to visualize the dynamics of methylation patterns spanning seven swine tissues at three developmental stages. We informed the penalty matrices guiding regularization with results from hierarchical clustering of RNA-Seq data.
   - We used the rags2risges R package network extraction, visualization and analysis
